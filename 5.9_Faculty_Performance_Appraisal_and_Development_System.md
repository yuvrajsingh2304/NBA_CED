## Faculty Performance Appraisal and Development System

Faculty members of Higher Educational Institutions today have to perform a variety of tasks pertaining to diverse roles. In addition to instruction, Faculty members need to innovate and conduct research for their self-renewal, keep abreast with changes in technology, and develop expertise for effective implementation of curricula. They are also expected to provide services to the industry and community for understanding and contributing to the solution of real-life problems in industry. Another role relates to the shouldering of administrative responsibilities and co-operation with other Faculty, Heads-of-Departments and the Head of Institute. An effective performance appraisal system for Faculty is vital for optimizing the contribution of individual Faculty to institutional performance.

The Faculty Performance is evaluated by HOD, which is forwarded to the Principal after every Academic year with the use of appraisal form in the form of Annual Confidential Report
